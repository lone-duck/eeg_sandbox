# eeg_sandbox

`eeg_sandbox` is a Python library and collection of scripts intended to allow for quick and easy experimentation with binary classification tasks on EEG data, and was specifically developed for the purpose of concussion diagnosis.

To run the code you'll need Python3 and all the necessary dependencies. The easiest way to accomplish this is by downloading and installing [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/).

The code makes use of the [catch22](https://github.com/chlubba/catch22) feature set, which must be downloaded and installed before it will run. Follow the instructions for installation at the link. The contents of `wrap_Python` should be placed in the `code` directory after installation.

All functions in `eeg_sandbox.py` are fully documented, and the included example scripts illustrate appropriate use of these functions. If you require further assistance, feel free to contact me at dylan.green (at) alumni.ubc.ca.
